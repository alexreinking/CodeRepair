\section{Conclusions and Future Directions}
\label{sec:concl}
We have seen that our algorithm efficiently subsumes the work done in \cite{GveroETAL13CompleteCompletionTypesWeights, MandelinetALL2005Jungloid, PerelmanGBG12} and extends it to the problem of program repair. Using our novel graph-theoretic approach, we efficiently solve instances of this problem to synthesize a correct expression from the salvageable parts of a broken one. We believe that the algorithm in its current state has two compelling uses. First, it can assist programmers in writing complex expressions. Second, it could be integrated into a compiler to provide enhanced error messages that not only point to errors, but offer ways to correct them. We believe that our algorithm will perform useful and effective repairs that are well-aligned with the developer's intentions, even when the given ill-typed expression requires several steps to repair.
