Our work is largely inspired by two synthesis tools: Prospector \cite{MandelinetALL2005Jungloid} and InSynth \cite{GveroETAL13CompleteCompletionTypesWeights, DBLP:conf/cav/GveroKP11}. Prospector is a tool for synthesizing code snippets containing only unary API methods. The basic synthesis algorithm used in \cite{MandelinetALL2005Jungloid} encodes method signatures using a graph. Although we also encode function information in a graph structure, our synthesis graph is more general. As explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:algorithm:graph}, we distinguish nodes into types and functions, as opposed to just types. In a way, the connections to each function node models its succinct type as described in \cite{GveroETAL13CompleteCompletionTypesWeights}. While our approach acts as a generalization of both these tools, we also extend their capability. Our algorithm can repair ill-typed expressions, as well.

Debugging and locating errors in code \cite{Pavlinovic:2014, Chandra:2011:AD} play an important role in the process of increasing software reliability. While our approach suggests repairs based only on a given ill-typed expression and its environment, other tools that tackle this problem, such as MintHint \cite{MintHint}, require test cases and symbolic execution.
