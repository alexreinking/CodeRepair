Debugging and locating errors in the code \cite{Pavlinovic:2014,
  Chandra:2011:AD} play an important role in the process of increasing
software reliability. Once located, some errors can be easily
fixed. Recently we have witnessed to a number of tools that aim to
repair parts of code. MintHint \cite{MintHint} is such a tool that
takes a more complete-program approach to code repair. Where we are
using user input to guide synthesis of a correctly-typed expression
from an incorrectly-typed one, MintHint targets a particular passage
that is suspected to carry a bug. MintHint synthesizes some hints in
areas that the algorithm considers erroneous, by both symbolically and
actually executing the code and comparing its output to test cases.
