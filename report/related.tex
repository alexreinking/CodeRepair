Code repair is cool, references...

MintHint \cite{MintHint} takes a more complete-program approach to code repair. Where we are using user input to guide synthesis of a correctly-typed expression from an incorrectly-typed one, their tool targets a particular passage that is suspected to carry a bug. MintHint synthesizes some hints in areas the algorithm considers erroneous, by both symbolically and actually executing the code and comparing its output to test cases.
