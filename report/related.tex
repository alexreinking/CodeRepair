Code repair is cool, references...

MintHint \cite{MintHint} takes a more complete-program approach to code repair. 
Where we are using the user input to guide synthesis of a correctly-typed expression from an incorrectly-typed one, 
their method targets a function that is suspected to carry a bug. MintHint synthesizes some hints in areas the algorithm considers problematic, by 
both symbolically and actually executing it and comparing the result to test cases.
