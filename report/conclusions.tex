\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
We have described an algorithm and a tool that performs a type-based synthesis and repair.
The user can give a hint of an intended code, or just provide a type of a desired code snippet, and our tool returns a list of 



We have presented a new tool that helps programmers to write complex expressions.
