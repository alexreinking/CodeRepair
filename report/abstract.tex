Developing enterprise software often requires composing several libraries together with a large body of in-house code. Especially in object-oriented languages like Java, these libraries might add hundreds of classes, along with thousands of methods, constants, and functions to the environment, which adds a great deal of complexity for the developer to manage. Modern programming conventions favor composing many ``small" objects together to create larger structures, or to delegate functionality or resource acquisition to other modules in a program. While useful, these techniques steepen the learning curve, and it is not uncommon for a developer to have no idea where to start.

We describe an algorithm and an immediate application that helps mitigate this problem in an IDE setting. At the core of our work is a graph construction that expresses the relationships between the language's types and methods, and allows us to synthesize expressions that are biased towards a given criteria simply by setting the edge weights appropriately. We implement our algorithm as part of an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that proposes corrections for ill-typed expressions in the Java language.
