\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section we present the results of our tool on some typical-use benchmarks. The runtimes were measured on a computer equipped with 32GB of RAM, a 4-core Intel Xeon E5-1620 CPU clocked at 3.60 GHz, running Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.0 on the Oracle JVM version 8u25. The best times of 50 consecutive trials were recorded to account for variance in process scheduling, cache behavior, and, most importantly, JVM warmup. It was not uncommon to see four or five time speed increases between the best and the worst measurements of the algorithm. This is due to the delay in program optimization afforded by the Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler built in to the JVM.
